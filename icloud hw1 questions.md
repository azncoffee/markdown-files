### 1. In table format:

- define the following cloud computing terms (Column 1)
- explain one key advantage each offers over traditional on-premise delivery models (Column 2)
- provide an example of how Apple iCloud  uses or enables that feature (Column 3)

		1. On-Demand Usage
		2. Ubiquitous Access
		3. Multitenancy (and Resource Pooling)
		4. Elasticity
		5. Measured Usage
		6. Resiliency

### 2. Using table format:

- compare the four main cloud deployment models:

		1. Public
		2. Private
		3. Hybrid
		4. Multi cloud.

- for each model, include:

		1. Definition
		2. Three Advantages
		3. Main Use Cases (e.g., in finance, government, healthcare, etc.)

### 3. List the five (Internet reference model) layers.

- briefly describe the responsibility of each layer. (Figure 4.4).
- list the main protocols for Layers 2-5, i.e. Ethernet, IP, TP, TCP/UDP HTTP and SMTP.

### 4. High Availability is one of the key technologies in modern cloud data centers.

- How is high availability measured?
- For a system with 99.99% availability, what is the average downtime per year (in minutes)?

### 5. A company is planning to run a cloud-based web application.

- They estimate the following monthly usage:

		1. Compute: 3 virtual machines (VMs), each costing $0.10 per hour, running 24/7.
		2. Storage: 500 GB of ojbect storage at $0.02 per GB per month.
		3. Data Outbound Transfer: 1,000 GB per month at $0.09 per GB.

- What is the total estimated monthly cost of running this workload in the cloud?
