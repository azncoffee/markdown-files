I finally understand why __*research papers*__ are published in `LaTeX`,

and why `README` __*files*__ & `.ipynb` __*notebooks*__ are published in `Markdown`...

.\

.

It's because these _**ultra-kawaii**_ `markup languages` will make you never want to touch `Microsoft Word` or `Google Docs` ever again.

- Unlike __`notepad`__, those *__disgrace to word processors__* were obviously built for _**casuals**_, not _uber gamers_ with __`1337` *micro*__ such as myself
__AND__ _whomever_ (ðŸ«µ) is fortunate enough to be __*witnessing*__ this ~cringe~ **incredible** display of `.md` _syntactic_ prowess ðŸ˜Ž (*__OMG__* so ðŸ†’!). _kyaaaa_**~**
